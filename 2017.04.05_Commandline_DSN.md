Lesson 4 Homework: Command Line Chipotle

2017.04.05

# (1) Look at the head and tail of chipotle.tsv in the data subdirectory of this repo. Think for a minute about how the data is structured. What do you think each column means? What do you think each row means? Tell me! (If you're unsure, look at more of the file contents.)

Retrowave86sMBP:~ retrowave86$ cd documents/GA/DS-SEA-06/data

Retrowave86sMBP:data retrowave86$ head chipotle.tsv

Retrowave86sMBP:data retrowave86$ tail chipotle.tsv

Looking at the data, it appears to be a dataset from a Chipotle store that details out the orders over some period of time.  My guess would be one business day since there were 1834 orders.  

The columns are organized by:

order_number: essentially the client

quantity: quantity of an item ordered

item_name: what the actual item ordered was

choice_description: Any add ons or changes to the default item (i.e. adding guacamole, salsa, etc.)
Item_Price: the cost for the item ordered


The rows in this dataset are the line items per column, or what was actually ordered.  It’s important to note that each row does not signify a new order.  In other words, an order number can have multiple rows of data.

# (2) How many orders do there appear to be?
Using the tails function, there appears to be 1834 orders in this dataset.

# (3) How many lines are in this file?

Retrowave86sMBP:data retrowave86$ wc -l chipotle.tsv
    4623 chipotle.tsv

There are 4,623 lines in this file.

# (4) Which burrito is more popular, steak or chicken? (OFFICE HOURS QUESTION ON QUANTITY - CAN I SORT AND COUNT SUM VALUES IN A COLUMN)

Retrowave86sMBP:data retrowave86$ grep "Steak Burrito" chipotle.tsv | wc -l
     368

Retrowave86sMBP:data retrowave86$ grep "Chicken Burrito" chipotle.tsv | wc -l
     553

Considering there are more line items that have the words “Chicken burrito” in it, I would assume that Chicken Burritos are more popular.  The problem with this method is that the “quantity” column is not taken into account. How many people ordered two burritos as apposed to just one.  To approach this issue, I used the following:

Retrowave86sMBP:data retrowave86$ grep "Chicken Burrito" chipotle.tsv | grep "2" | wc -l
     267

Retrowave86sMBP:data retrowave86$ grep "Steak Burrito" chipotle.tsv | grep "2" | wc -l
     197

It appears that there were still more line items that had a quantity of 2 for chicken burritos as opposed to steak burritos (267 chicken and 197 steak).

# (5) Do chicken burritos more often have black beans or pinto beans? (OFFICE HOURS QUESTION ON QUANTITY - CAN I SORT AND COUNT SUM VALUES IN A COLUMN)

Black beans appear to be the most preferred choice.

Retrowave86sMBP:data retrowave86$ grep "Chicken Burrito" chipotle.tsv | grep "Black Beans" | wc -l
     282

Retrowave86sMBP:data retrowave86$ grep "Chicken Burrito" chipotle.tsv | grep "Pinto Beans" | wc -l
     105

# (6) Make a list of all of the CSV or TSV files in the [our class repo] (https://github.com/ga-students/DS-SEA-3). repo (using a single command). You will be working on your local repo on your laptop. Think about how wildcard characters can help you with this task.

# (7) Count the approximate number of occurrences of the word "dictionary" (regardless of case) across all files of [our class repo] (https://github.com/ga-students/DS-SEA-3).

The word dictionary occurs approximately 80 times in our class repo.

Retrowave86s-MacBook-Pro:ga retrowave86$ grep -r -i dictionary DS-SEA-06| wc -l
      80


# (8) Optional: Use the the command line to discover something "interesting" about the Chipotle data. Try using the commands from the "advanced" section!

This isn’t anything really interesting about the Chipotle data, but instead something interesting that I found with respect to the sort function.  Originally I thought that the function would sort the order number from lowest value to highest value.  Instead, it sorted the order number in order of successive numbers.  For example, it would not go “1, 2, 3, 4” but instead go “1, 10, 100, 11, 110”
